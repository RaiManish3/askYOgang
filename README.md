Followed [this](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide initially to develop on top of it.
Not exactly sure of what am I leading to at the last place, here is a short to-do list for near future:

1. Add individual identity to clients that should only be displayed in console.
2. Change background (style of webpage broadly).
3. Show how many total clients are active in console.
4. Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
5. Add private messaging ;)
